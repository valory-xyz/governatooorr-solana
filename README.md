# Governatooorr Solana

The [Governatooorr](https://governatooorr.autonolas.network/) is an autonomous, AI-powered delegate that votes on on-chain governance proposals on the Etherum and Solana mainnets. The Ethereum version is already deployed, and will be followed by the Solana deployment.

Governatooorr runs on the [Olas Network](https://olas.network/) and builds on top/interacts with the following components:

* [Governatooorr Solana service](https://github.com/valory-xyz/governatooorr/): main implementation of the service.
* [Open Autonomy transaction settlement skill](https://github.com/valory-xyz/open-autonomy): a framework for the creation of autonomous agent services.
* [Solana Open AEA plugin](https://github.com/valory-xyz/open-aea/tree/main/plugins/aea-ledger-solana)
* [Autonolas registries Solana integration](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-registries/tree/main/integrations/solana): registries for components, agents and services, the second part of the autonolas-v1 protocol.
